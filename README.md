 am a sophomore at the University of Arizona, where I study computer science and mathematics. During my undergraduate years, I want to explore the tech field as well to find my true passion. After graduation, I am planning to work in the industry before I continue my education in graduate school.

Currently my interests are web-development, software architecture and database design.
