## About me
I am passionate about software development, architecting scalable solutions, and writing concise code. Being able to develop something useful and seeing it works make me happy

Through college and work experience, I developed many projects using diverse technologies like C#, Haskell, Prolog, Java, JavaScript, AWS, LISP, and relational databases. Some of the fields I have been fortunate to work in include:
+ Internet of Things, with the focus on LoRaWAN devices
+ Authentication and authorization in systems with millions of users
+ Web development
+ Tailored graph algorithms and data dtructures 
+ Designing scalable, safe cloud solutions
## Education
I am double majoring in computer science and mathematics. I believe these fields complement each other perfectly.
