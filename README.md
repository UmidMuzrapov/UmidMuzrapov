## About me
I am into software development, architecting scalable solutions, and writing concise code. Tough problems motivate me. Through college and work experience, I developed several software systems using diverse technologies like C#, Java, ASP.NET, AWS, LISP, Prolog, Haskell, Docker, GitHub, and relational databases. Some of the fields I have been fortunate to work in include:
+ Internet of Things, with the focus on LoRaWAN devices
+ Authentication and authorization in systems with millions of users
+ Web development
+ Tailored graph algorithms and data structures 
+ Designing scalable, safe cloud solutions
## Education
I am double majoring in computer science and mathematics. My expected graduation date is May, 2025.
