## About me
I am into software development, architecting scalable solutions, and writing concise code. Tough problems motivate me. Through college and work experience, I co-developed several software systems using diverse technologies like C#, Java, ASP.NET, AWS, Docker, GitHub, and relational databases. Some of the fields I have been fortunate to work in include: 
+ Internet of Things, with the focus on LoRaWAN devices
+ Web development with millions of users.
+ Tailored graph algorithms and data structures 
+ Designing scalable, safe cloud solutions

## Education
I am double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My expected graduation date is May, 2025.
